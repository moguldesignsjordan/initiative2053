      <h1>Your Path to Homeownership Starts Here</h1>

      <p>
        Nearly half of Detroit households rent — many paying more for rent than
        they would for a mortgage. Initiative 2053 provides a clear path toward
        sustainable homeownership through education, credit support, and
        down-payment assistance. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
      </p>

      <h2>What You’ll Receive</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Credit & budgeting support</li>
        <li>Homebuyer readiness education</li>
        <li>DPA grants to close the affordability gap</li>
        <li>Clear guidance from intake to closing day</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Detroit’s future belongs to Detroiters — and we’re building a roadmap
        to get you there.
